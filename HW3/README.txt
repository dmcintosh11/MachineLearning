   Homework 3: Convolutional Neural Network

2. No known errors

3. Used links in assignment to get dataset.
	Used https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritikseth/fruit-and-vegetable-image-recognition for data
	Used classwork to help remember code as well as conceptually how to handle CNNs
	Was having difficulty importing data from file into the model to train so I used https://www.kaggle.com/code/databeru/fruit-and-vegetable-classification to help
		Also found useful code to help display graphs that describe the data as well as model predictions in that link above
